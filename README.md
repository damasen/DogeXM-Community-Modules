# DogeXM Community Modules

This repository contains all the community written modules for DogeXM, my IRC bot in #dogecoin

If you would like to write a module, simply
 * Fork this repo
 * Create your module
 * Submit a pull request
 * I will review and test your module
 * Your module will be added to DogeXM should it be accepted


If you would like to update a module written by someone else, that's fine too. Follow the same steps above.

DogeXM modules are written in Python, and the bot base is [Code by Liam Stanley](https://github.com/Liamraystanley/Code). I'd recommend setting up a simple version of Code on your local machine to test your modules.

You can look at existing modules or read the [Code API here](https://github.com/Liamraystanley/Code/wiki/API) to learn how to make a module.

If you need help, feel free to ask me on IRC, via PM or in ##cr5315
